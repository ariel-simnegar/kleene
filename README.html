      <p>Try kleene.js! Input your regular expression below.  Regular expressions are defined by the following rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The string "0" is a regular expression denoting the empty language.</li>
        <li>Any character a that is NOT "\", "(", ")", "0", "+", "*", or "位" is a regular expression denoting the language {a}. The strings "\\", "\(", "\)", "\0", "\+", "\*", and "\位" are the regular expressions denoting the languages {"\"}, {"("}, {")"}, {"0"}, {"+"}, {"*"}, and {"位"} respectively.</li>
        <li>If "S" and "T" are regular expressions denoting languages L(S) and L(T), then "S+T" is a regular expression denoting the union of L(S) and L(T). Note that this sense of "+" in formal language theory is different from the usual sense indicating one or more occurences of the preceding regular expression.</li>
        <li>If "S" and "T" are regular expressions denoting languages L(S) and L(T), then "ST" is a regular expression denoting the concatenation product of L(S) and L(T). The concatenation product of languages A and B is the language of all strings uv such that u is in A and v is in B.</li>
        <li>If "S" is the regular expression denoting the language L(S), "S*" is a regular expression denoting the Kleene star of L(S). The Kleene star A* of a language A is defined as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>位 is in A*.</li>
            <li>If u is in A* and v is in A, then the concatenation uv is in A*.</li>
            <li>The only strings in A* are those given by the above rules.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The only regular expressions are those defined by the above rules.</li>
      </ol>
